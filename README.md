This is the source repository for the geooperator browser based on faceted browsing.

The current version is deployed at http://purl.org/net/geooperators.

For historical reasons, the original prototype can be accessed at http://purl.org/net/jbrauner/geooperators.

It needs to be deployed as is in a Web Server (e.g. Apache or Lightttp).

The software is based on Exihibt 2 which originally is released under this BSD licence.
Please send any questions to Johannes Brauner (https://github.com/jbrauner).
